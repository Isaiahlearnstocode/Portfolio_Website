            <p>Hello! My name is Isaiah and I enjoy making coding projects and solving problems that I believe that I can fix. My first coding class was back in middle school where we were taught the basics of HTML and CSS. Ever since then I knew that this would be something that I would want to be doing for the rest of my life.</p>
            <p>Since that time has passed, I have now enrolled at Harrisburg University of Science and Technology where I plan to graduate. This degree will come with a <a class="in-text-links" href = "https://www.abet.org/about-abet/ ">ABET Accreditation </a> as well. I am currently working on serval projects but, my main focus is to continue to learn about data structures. </p>
            <p>Here my skills that I've learned so far:</p>

    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p>
    <p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software.</p>
    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC. A Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia discovered the source.</p>
    <p>Lorem Ipsum comes from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.</p>
